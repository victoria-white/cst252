	<h3>Purpose</h3>
	<p>The purpose of this lab was to experiment with JavaScript Functions with our partners.
	For this assignment, we were supposed to write a JavaScript function that gets a name from the
user and then sorts the letters and then returns the value back to the user.</p>

	<h3>Challenges</h3>
	<p>This lab was a challenge for me, I've never gotten the hang of JavaScript functions that quickly.
		Even during the JavaScript class that I took while I was in community college, I always struggled
	with them. However, I'm hopeful that I'll be able to get the hang of it soon!</p>
